# Spigot-ScoreboardAPI
An old ScoreboardAPI I wrote when I used to do Minecraft Plugin Development. Unsure if this works for modern versions.

## How to use it

Open the "ScoreboardAPI.txt" and put that into a file named ScoreboardAPI.java. Obviously, you'll need your package name at the top.

Change some things where needed like "MAINCLASSHERE", "NameOfPluginHere", "ScoreboardTitleHere", "Scoreboard Title"

## Credit

You can choose to credit me if you wish, i'm really not that bothered. At the end of the day, it's a Scoreboard API.
It would be nice to see people credit me, of course. However, if for some reason you hate crediting people, then do as you wish.
